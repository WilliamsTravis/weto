Arc Raster Rescue Installation Instructions

To use this python wrapper to rescue a raster from an ESRI Geodatabase follow
these steps:
    
    1) Clone this repository:

        https://github.com/r-barnes/ArcRasterRescue.git
    
    2) In this directory run:

        `make`

    3) An .exe file will be created. Either provide the containing directory
       path of this file as the "exe_dir" argument to the 'arc_raster' python
       method or set its full path to this alias:

       'alias arc_raster=/path/to/file.exe'
    
    4) Run mukey_rescue(path_to_gdb, **kwargs)
