WETO Soil Notes


Examining the possibility of create a map of depth to rockbottom and 
maps of soil classifications at different depths. This is intended to
help refine construction restraints/costs for wind turbine projects. 
We are using gSSURGO and gNATSGO. gNATSGO combine gSSURGO, STATSGO,
and the newer Raster Soil Survey (limited space only) to try and fill
in gaps in coverage.

- Maps of depth to rock bottom are proving to be quite sparse. There are
areas where it might be worth it to interpol

- The categorization of soil types at different depths is an ongoing project
for me, and I imagine we will encounter similar coverage issues as with
depth to rock bottom estimates. 

- It is likely that the sparseness of these coverages will necessitate
some sort of interpolation or statistical estimation method:
