Landscan Population Grids

We are attempting to use the LandScan "Ambient Population" product to characterize
populations within supply curve points in reV runs. These datasets can be found
here:

These appear to come in ESRI geodatabases as counts. So we'll need to extract the
rasters, reproject to our albers equal area conic projection, resample using mean
and multiply by the number of resampled pixels per original pixel (summation isn't
availabe for some reason). 

Should we use each year available? How to incorporate day vs night time ambient
populations.
